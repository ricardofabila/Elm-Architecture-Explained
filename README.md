# Elm-Architecture-Explained
A js incrementer designed to explain how the elm architecture works.

This simple App (which is on the try-elm site), was rewritten in plain vanilla Js as an example to show better how the Elm Architecture (for Elm 0.18) works without the need to learn a new language and a new paradigm.

### This demo was created as a part of a conference I gave at the University Anahuac Mayab in Mérida, México about the Elm  programming language.
